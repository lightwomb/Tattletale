Tattletale
==========
<i>Meet your annoying new accountability partner...a feisty little package that loves nothing more than to tell people how much of a dead beat you've been.</i>

<h3>Remember that <i>"thing"</i> you said you were gonna do but never ended up doing because you ...ummm, ...yeah, ...<i>forgot?</i></h3>

<p>Well, now you look like a idiot, because this little brat just sent emails to all of the contacts you don't want to disappoint and/or let down. "[your name here] does not seem to be very reliable..." is what you're friends/family/boss/collegues/ex-girlfriend will be thinking when they read about how you so carelessly blew off your responsibilities because you were too busy sucking at life.</p>

<h4>Oh wait, that's right, you forgot. It's ok, you just forgot, it's not that big of a deal, everything will work out.</h4>

<p>Just kidding, it's not ok, and it most definitely will NOT work out. Otherwise you'd have never cued some stupid app to trigger an email in order to inform people of what they probably already know...that you my friend, are a waste of space. Stop being a pile of worthlessness and stay on top of your sh*t!.</p>

<p>Tattletale can help by supplying the tiny push we all need to remember our commitments and inpire productivity; motivation to not look like an low-life ass in front of people we care about.</p>
